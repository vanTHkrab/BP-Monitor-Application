# SDK and API Automation

Use this reference when building automation rather than using `create-prisma` or `@prisma/cli app deploy`.

## Prefer the CLI for App Workflows

For normal app deployment:

1. Use generated `compute:deploy` when present.
2. Otherwise use `@prisma/cli app build/run/deploy`.
3. Use SDK/API only for custom automation, platform integrations, or tool builders.

## Compute SDK

Install:

```bash
npm install @prisma/compute-sdk @prisma/management-api-sdk
```

Create an authenticated Management API client:

```typescript
import { createManagementApiClient } from "@prisma/management-api-sdk"

const apiClient = createManagementApiClient({
  token: process.env.PRISMA_API_TOKEN,
})
```

Token naming differs by surface. Current `@prisma/cli app ...` uses `PRISMA_SERVICE_TOKEN` for non-interactive service-token auth. The SDK examples here use `PRISMA_API_TOKEN` as an application convention for passing a token into `createManagementApiClient`; the SDK itself only receives the `token` string.

Deploy a prebuilt artifact:

```typescript
import { ComputeClient, PreBuilt } from "@prisma/compute-sdk"

const compute = new ComputeClient(apiClient)
const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL
if (!databaseUrl) throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is required")

const result = await compute.deploy({
  strategy: new PreBuilt({
    appPath: "./dist",
    entrypoint: "index.js",
  }),
  projectId: "proj_abc",
  serviceName: "my-app",
  region: "us-east-1",
  envVars: { DATABASE_URL: databaseUrl },
  portMapping: { http: 3000 },
})

if (result.isOk()) {
  console.log(result.value.versionEndpointDomain)
} else {
  console.error(result.error.message)
}
```

SDK methods return `Result<T, E>`. Check `isOk()` or `isErr()` instead of assuming errors throw.

## SDK Build Strategies

Current project-compute SDK strategies:

- `AutoBuild`: tries Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, TanStack Start, then Bun
- `NextjsBuild`: requires standalone output and returns `server.js`
- `NuxtBuild`: expects `.output/server/index.mjs`
- `AstroBuild`: expects `dist/server/entry.mjs`
- `TanstackStartBuild`: runs `vite build` and expects a Nitro node server at `.output/server/index.mjs`; keep `tanstackStart()` and `nitro()` in Vite config
- `BunBuild`: runs `bun build` and needs an explicit entrypoint or `package.json` `main`
- `PreBuilt`: uses an existing artifact directory and relative entrypoint

The launch Platform CLI may support a different or newer framework list. Verify help output before applying SDK-era assumptions to user-facing CLI commands.

## Regions

Known SDK region ids:

```text
us-east-1
us-west-1
eu-west-3
eu-central-1
ap-northeast-1
ap-southeast-1
```

The `create-prisma` deploy flow does not select a region because `app deploy` does not expose a region flag. Do not ask for a region in that flow unless current help output supports it.

## Management API Concepts

Compute resources map roughly to:

- Project: parent container
- Branch: production or preview scope for env resolution and database/env attachment
- Compute service/app: stable app endpoint and branch attachment
- Compute version/deployment: build artifact plus runtime status and preview URL

Low-level service/version routes include:

- list/create compute services under a project
- get/update/delete compute service
- create/list/get/start/stop/delete compute versions
- promote a version to the service endpoint
- stream logs for a version
- manage custom domains

Environment variables are not embedded directly in the low-level version create payload. They resolve from the service's attached Branch. Use project/environment-variable APIs or CLI env commands to write env vars first, and keep the branch name consistent across app/service creation, database creation, and env writes.

When using the CLI alongside SDK automation:

```bash
bunx @prisma/cli@latest project env add --file .env.preview --branch feature/foo
bunx @prisma/cli@latest database create preview-db --branch feature/foo --json
bunx @prisma/cli@latest app deploy --branch feature/foo --json --no-interactive
```

Production promotion is not just "the same branch with another label"; current `app promote <deployment-id>` rebuilds with production env vars.

## Secrets and Redaction

Management API version inspection exposes env var names with redacted values. Treat any value like `[redacted]` as a marker, not as the deployed value.

Do not log:

- service tokens
- OAuth tokens
- full database URLs
- env var values
- pre-signed upload URLs

## Legacy Standalone Compute CLI

Older project-compute examples use `@prisma/compute-cli` with commands like:

```bash
bunx @prisma/compute-cli deploy --path .
bunx @prisma/compute-cli services list --project <project-id>
bunx @prisma/compute-cli versions list --service <service-id>
```

Use this only when the user's project or docs explicitly use `@prisma/compute-cli`. For new launch guidance, prefer `@prisma/cli app ...`.
