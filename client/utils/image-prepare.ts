/**
 * Resize + recompress an image to a sane size before handing it off to the
 * AI analysis pipeline. Enforces two invariants on the output:
 *
 *   - long edge  ≤ MAX_LONG_EDGE_PX (1600) — soft cap, downscaled if over
 *   - short edge ≥ MIN_SHORT_EDGE_PX (512) — hard floor, upscaled if under
 *
 * When the source already satisfies both, the work is skipped entirely so
 * we don't waste a JPEG re-encode pass. For pathologically elongated
 * inputs where the cap and floor disagree (e.g. a 4000x200 banner), the
 * floor wins — the backend pipeline cannot recover from a sub-512 input,
 * but it can tolerate an oversized long edge.
 *
 * Dimensions are taken from the caller (both `Camera.takePictureAsync` and
 * `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` return `width` / `height` on the
 * asset already) — we never call `Image.getSize`, which has been observed
 * to hang on a just-written camera URI on some Android devices and was
 * leaving the capture UI stuck.
 *
 * Returns both the post-resize URI AND the new dimensions because callers
 * (notably the on-device YOLO pre-flight) need to know the *actual* pixel
 * size of the file behind the URI — passing the pre-resize dimensions to
 * downstream crops causes out-of-bounds rejections.
 *
 * On any failure we return the original URI + dimensions so the rest of
 * the flow keeps working with the un-resized image rather than blocking
 * on the resize.
